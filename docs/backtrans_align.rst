``backtrans-align``
===================

Given a protein alignment and unaligned nucleotides, align the nucleotides
using the protein alignment. Protein and nucleotide sequence files must
contain the same number of sequences, in the same order, with the same IDs.

This command now provides the full ``pal2nal`` feature set, including multiple
output formats and codon table selection.
